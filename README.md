# Python-FOC-Project-3

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to simulate a card game with Python. The rules of this game is loosely based on the board game Sushi-Go.

## Project Questions
There are 4 stages to this project

1. Group Scoring: attach a score to each of the possible groupings of cards passed to this stage.
2. Group Validating: determining whether this grouping is valid. The criteria for validation is specified in the Instructions.
3. Implementing Group Scoring and Group Validating in a function to play the game.
4. Optimising the strategies in stage 3.

You will also need to write and submit a set of test cases for evaluating the function in Question 3 (Question 4)

## Instructions
Due to the abundance and complexity of the specs, the remainder of the project specifications will be detailed in the *Instructions* pdf in this repo.
